My name is Ben Holmes and I am passionate about audio and music technology. I have nearly completed my PhD in Electronic Engineering at the Sonic Arts Research Centre, Queen's University Belfast. Throughout the PhD I have [published at the DAFx conference on my research](/publications/) mainly into component and circuit level identification in an attempt to improve the fidelity of physical circuit models.

On this site you will find my collected work, some modelling/research related blog posts, a brief CV (a longer one available on my LinkedIn), and a link to research resources from my publications. [Shoot me an email](mailto:me@benholmes.co.uk) if you have any questions about what's here :)
