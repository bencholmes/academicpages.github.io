I'm currently a PhD student at the Sonic Arts Research Centre (SARC) @ Queen's University Belfast, researching digital emulation of musical circuits.

**Presentation @ DAFx 17**: The annual conference was held this September at the University of Edinburgh. This year I presented "Comparison of Germanium Bipolar Junction Transistor models for real-time circuit simulation", a paper co-authored with Martin Holters at Helmut Schmidt University and Maarten van Walstijn.

**Talk @ CCRMA**: Whilst in California this summer I was kindly invited by Kurt Werner to present on Virtual Analog at CCRMA as a part of the seminar "Two Approaches to Virtual Analog Modeling". My talk, entitled "Replicating Vintage Guitar Pedals: Characterisation of Physical Virtual Analogue Circuits" detailed my recent work on optimising circuit models to input/output data from a measured circuit.

**Internship @ Apple**: I took 5 months out from my PhD to intern with the Audio Hardware group in Cupertino.
